# Tetris-Player

This repository contains the code used for my Tetris reinforcement learning project. The lua script is intened to be used with the Bizhawk emulator.

The main ideas is to pipeline data from the emulated RAM addresses into a neural network to assign button presses on a frame by frame basis.
